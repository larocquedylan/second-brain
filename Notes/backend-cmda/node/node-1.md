# Node

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (meaning instructions are exectuved directly, not compiled) or JIT-compiled (Just-in-time compiling i.e. compiling at runtime) programming language with first-class functions (functions are treated like any other variables i.e. functions can be returned). While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

JS is event based and non-blocking.

## what is node?

Node.js is a run-time environment for executing JS code server-side. It is built on Chrome's v8 Js engine. Node enables JS for server-side scripting, and run scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browsers. Node uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O. Node's package ecosystem (NPM) is the largest ecosystem of open sources libraries in the world.

## Js in the browsers vs. in Node

In Node, you get JS, Console, Timers, global, File System, http, require / module, Buffer,...
