# HTTP Requests

HTTP requests are another common side-effect that we need to do in applications. This is no different from the side-effects we need to apply to a rendered DOM or when interacting with browser APIs like localStorage. In all these cases, we do that within a useEffect hook callback. This hook allows us to ensure that whenever certain changes take place, we apply the side-effects based on those changes.

One important thing to note about the useEffect hook is that you cannot return anything other than the cleanup function. This kind of messes up async operations for us. For example

    // this does not work, don't do this:
    React.useEffect(async () => {
    const result = await doSomeAsyncThing()
    // do something with the result
    })

This won't work because async/await functions return a promise, irregardless if we are returning anything. So, we must do it this way...

    React.useEffect(() => {
    async function effect() {
        const result = await doSomeAsyncThing()
        // do something with the result
    }
    effect()
    })

This way, we are only returning the cleanupFunction.

Probably best to abstract async operations away into a utility function and use the promise chanining within the useEffect.

    React.useEffect(() => {
    doSomeAsyncThing().then(result => {
        // do something with the result
    })
    })
