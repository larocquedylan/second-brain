# useRef

Basically, we implement the `useRef` hook anytime we want to reference something and want to be able to make changes to that thing without rerendering the entire app.

If you want to rerender the app, implement a `useState`

`useRef`returns an object that has a current property on it. That current propoerty is mutable.

To get access to a DOM node that React creates we use the `useRef` hook.
